## 🔬 **Experiment No. 7: Array Operations in C++**

---

### ✅ **Aim:**

To write C++ programs that perform basic array operations such as:

* Input and output of array elements
* Searching for an element
* Reversing the array
* Calculating the sum and average
* Finding the minimum and maximum elements

---

### 📚 **Theory:**

Arrays are linear data structures that store multiple values of the same type in contiguous memory locations. They provide fast access using indexing and are fundamental for handling lists of data.
In this experiment, we explored how to manipulate arrays using loops and conditional statements in C++.

### 🧠 **Algorithms Used:**

1. **Input & Output:**
   Loop through the array using `for` loop to take input and display elements.

2. **Search Element:**
   Take user input for the target element, then use linear search to check each index.

3. **Reverse Array:**
   Print array elements from the last index to the first using a reverse loop.

4. **Sum & Average:**
   Initialize `sum = 0`. Add each element to `sum`, then divide by the total number (5) for average.

5. **Min & Max Finder:**
   Initialize `min` and `max` to the first element, then compare each element to update them accordingly.

### 📝 **Conclusion:**

This experiment helped me understand how arrays work and how to use them efficiently in solving real-world problems. Each operation — whether it's searching, reversing, or finding extremes — is a core skill in programming.
By mastering these basics, I'm building a solid foundation for advanced topics like data structures and algorithms.
