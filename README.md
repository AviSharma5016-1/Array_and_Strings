## **Aim**
To implement and demonstrate basic operations on arrays and strings in C++, including input/output, finding minimum and maximum, reversing, palindrome checking, concatenation, searching, sum, and average.

## **Theory**
Arrays and strings are foundational data structures in C++ programming. Arrays are collections of elements (typically of the same data type) stored in contiguous memory. Strings are sequences of characters. Mastering basic operations on these data types helps in building strong problem-solving skills and forms a base for more advanced topics like data structures and algorithms.

## **Experiments and Algorithms**

### **1. Array Input and Output**
- **Algorithm:**  
  1. Declare an integer array of size 5.  
  2. Read 5 integers from the user into the array.  
  3. Print each element.
- **Observation:**  
  Accepts 5 numbers and displays them line by line.

### **2. String Palindrome Checking**
- **Algorithm:**  
  1. Read a string from the user.  
  2. Reverse the string by iterating from end to start.  
  3. Compare the original and the reversed string.  
  4. Print whether palindrome or not.
- **Observation:**  
  Recognises if a string is the same forwards and backwards.

### **3. Find Minimum and Maximum in Array**
- **Algorithm:**  
  1. Read an array of 5 integers.  
  2. Traverse the array, updating minimum and maximum as needed.  
  3. Output min and max values.
- **Observation:**  
  Correctly finds the smallest and largest elements in the array.

### **4. Reverse Array**
- **Algorithm:**  
  1. Read an array of 5 elements.  
  2. Output elements from the last index to first.
- **Observation:**  
  Displays the array in reverse order.

### **5. String Concatenation**
- **Algorithm:**  
  1. Input two strings.  
  2. Concatenate them with a space.  
  3. Output the combined string.
- **Observation:**  
  Joins two strings cleanly into one.

### **6. String Reversal**
- **Algorithm:**  
  1. Input a string.  
  2. Traverse from end to start, appending characters to a new string.  
  3. Output the reversed string.
- **Observation:**  
  Displays the string in reverse.

### **7. Simple String Input/Output**
- **Algorithm:**  
  1. Input a string.  
  2. Output the same string.
- **Observation:**  
  Verifies correct input/output of strings.

### **8. Array Sum and Average**
- **Algorithm:**  
  1. Input 5 integers into an array.  
  2. Calculate the sum by traversal.  
  3. Compute the average as the sum divided by 5.
- **Observation:**  
  Calculates both total and mean correctly.

### **9. Array Element Search**
- **Algorithm:**  
  1. Input 5 integers into an array.  
  2. Input an element to search.  
  3. Traverse the array and check if the element exists; output its position if found.
- **Observation:**  
  Finds and reports the position of the searched element; otherwise reports not found.

## **Conclusion/Result**
The experiments successfully demonstrate essential operations on arrays and strings in C++. These small programs build practical understanding and reinforce theoretical concepts, providing a foundation for more complex problem-solving and programming tasks.
